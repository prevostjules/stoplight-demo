# stoplight-demo
Demo project to highlight bundle differences between Stoplight 'export' button and swagger-cli bundle method 


The 'bundled' directory contains the result of multiple bundling using different tools:

- bundledWithExportButton.json => done by hitting the 'Export' button on [Stoplight Project](https://jules-prevost.stoplight.io/docs/stoplight-demo/5idsiq5fewftd-stoplight-demo)

- bundledWithJsonRefParser.json / bundledWithStoplightParser.json / bundledWithSwaggerParser.json => Done with multiple bundler using the command `npm run bundle`

- bundledWithSwaggerCli.json => done by playing this command in the terminal `swagger-cli bundle './reference/stoplight-demo.json' -o './bundled/bundledWithSwaggerCli.json'
  ` 
Swagger Cli version used: 4.0.4

What is the problem? 

In this blog post, the Stoplight team says that 'If youâ€™re using another OpenAPI editor, are muddling through with Vim, or need to bundle as part of an automated workflow via the CLI, you can use swagger-cli on the command line to get the same result as if you clicked the button in Studio.'

BUT, the result using swagger-cli (or '@stoplight/json-schema-ref-parser' or '@apidevtools/swagger-parser' or '@apidevtools/json-schema-ref-parser' ) is not exactly the same. 

The swagger parser result is less useful than the stoplight one. 

Differences: 

Stoplight 'Export' button copy and paste the external schema definitions in `components.schemas`. For the other bundlers, `components.schemas === {}`

This difference results in less clearer Refs. 

Ref to an external schema in the stoplight bundled version:
`"$ref": "#/components/schemas/User"`

Ref to this same external schema in the other solutions bundled version: "$ref": `"#/components/responses/UserSingle/content/application~1json/schema/properties/data"`
